    About
</h2>
<P>   Before the concern was primarily to build beautiful skyscrapers, there was a race to the sky; a need to build taller. Yet it's over the past century that we've seen a significant leap in the total height of our tallest skyscrapers (by definition, a skyscraper is a building that exceeds 330 feet). “The skyscraper and the twentieth century are synonymous; the tall building is the landmark of our age,” wrote architectural critic Ada Louise Huxtable in her 1984 book, The Tall Building Artistically Reconsidered: The Search for a Skyscraper Style. </P>
